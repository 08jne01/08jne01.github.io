<h2 id="about-the-a-4e-c-project">About the A-4E-C Project</h2>
<p>The A-4 was a cold war workhorse which proved to be a capable, reliable light attack aircraft to dozens of nations around the world. From the jungles of southeast Asia, to the desert of Sinai, to the coasts of South America, the scooter was a common sight above battlefields around the world for decades.</p>
<p>The A-4E-C represents more than five years of work on behalf of the development team. We&#39;re thrilled to share our most comprehensive DCS World module to date in this 2.0 <em>&quot;Forever Free&quot;</em> update, featuring a realistic flight model, improved systems simulations, increased functionality across all DCS World&#39;s available maps, full carrier compatibility, radios, air refueling, and improvements to the ground radar, sound feedback, textures, controls and inputs. This update also adds a user manual in PDF format as well as in the DCS kneeboard, packed with useful checklists and procedures that cover everything from start-up to weapons deployment.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t flown the A-4E-C since version 1.4, this is a great time to see it again for the first time. If you&#39;re new to DCS World, we hope you will find the A-4E-C a good option to learn to fly, and instructive in helping you decide what other modules you might want to pursue next.</p>
<p>We&#39;d like to thank the dozens of people in the DCS World community who have made contributions in bug reports, liveries, expertise, research, videos, community flight instruction, server hosting and for their camaraderie over the years. We dedicate the module to the memory of Eric &quot;Gospadin&quot; Mudama. This labor of love would not have been possible without his initial coding and project coordination.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Failure to perform these steps will result in DCS World not recognizing the module, inability to use the module, input errors when using the module, or client integrity check failures on multiplayer servers that require them. Never install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files! Installation size is around 1 GB.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-upgrading-from-an-older-release">STEP 1: Upgrading from an older release</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are upgrading from an older version of the A-4E-C, completely uninstall your old version. If this is a brand new installation, skip this and move on to Step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>First, uninstall the module&#39;s files from <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Next reset your A-4E-C input bindings by deleting the contents of <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Config\Input\A-4E-C</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-installing-the-module-files">STEP 2: Installing the module files</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Download <a href="https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/">the latest official A-4E-C release package</a>. Do not download directly from the Github repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place the <code>Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C</code> folder in into your Windows user folder&#39;s Saved Games folder for DCS, e.g. <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have installed other DCS World mods, you might already have the <code>Mods</code> and <code>aircraft</code> folders indicated in the file path. If so, merge the new A-4E-C folder into the existing folders.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Never install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files!</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-verify-installation">STEP 3: Verify installation</h3>
<p>Launch DCS World. If your installation was successful, the A-4E-C theme icon appears as a option in the main menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/926862242182488136/unknown.png" alt="Image of DCS World Menu with A-4E-C Theme"></p>
<h3 id="installation-troubleshooting">Installation Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Your correctly installed files should look something like the following image, substituting your Windows account name where the image displays <em>Partario</em>. If you&#39;re using the openbeta branch of DCS World, the folder might be <code>DCS.openbeta</code> instead of <code>DCS</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/886633761670828112/unknown.png" alt="Image of A-4E-C installation"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you have multiple DCS-related folders in your <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games</code>, for example, <code>DCS</code>, or <code>DCS.openbeta</code>. If you are unsure which folder your DCS World installation is using, locate the <code>dcs_variant.txt</code> file in the game files. If this file is present, its contents determines the folder structure your DCS World installation is using. Alternately, load DCS world and use the mission editor to create and save a mission. Search this mission file using Windows explorer to locate the proper folder structure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are receiving an authorization error at launch, <strong>you have installed the module incorrectly</strong>. Revisit the installation instructions above. Be sure to remove any and all improperly installed files before correctly installing the module.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the A-4E-C icon in the DCS main menu shows a default DCS logo, is missing the theme background and music (or you experience crashes when loading a mission), you have incorrectly downloaded the module. <a href="https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/">Download the latest official A-4E-C release package</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you can load a mission, but can&#39;t take control of the A-4E-C, ensure you have installed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0">Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 Redistributable libraries</a>. Restart your computer after installation of the appropriate libraries. For most users, this is <code>vc_redist.x64.exe</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you can&#39;t find the A-4E-C in the Mission Editor, ensure the historical mode filter is disabled by toggling the clock icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518814186739073024/759230033960763422/unknown.png" alt="Image of the Mission Editor pointing out the location of the Historical Filter"></p>
<h3 id="multiplayer-troubleshooting">Multiplayer Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A DCS standalone server hosting missions with the A-4E-C must have the A-4E-C module installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A server can host players who do not have the A-4E-C module installed on missions that feature it, you will need to be ready to get a little hands-on with your mission files. The Mission Editor dictates that any mission with an A4-E-C in it requires the module (just as it would any other aircraft), and it&#39;s <code>.miz</code> mission files are, in fact, <code>.zip</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a copy of your <code>.miz</code> file, and rename it with a <code>.zip</code> file extension, and unzip it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside, you will find a <code>mission</code> file (no extension). Open this file in your text editor of choice (Notepad works just fine), and search for <code>requiredModules</code>. Remove the A-4E-C&#39;s entry, as shown in this example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[<span class="hljs-string">"requiredModules"</span>] =
{
     [<span class="hljs-string">"A-4E-C"</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"A-4E-C"</span>,
}
</code></pre><ul>
<li><p>Once you have completed the edit, save the <code>mission</code> file, and re-create a new <code>.zip</code> (carefully maintaining proper folder structure, <em>of course</em>). Rename your modified mission <code>.zip</code> back to a DCS <code>.miz</code> file extension instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, test your altered mission by yourself or with a friend to ensure it loads properly, and that clients are able to load into the mission or server without the A4-E-C installed. In this instance, DCS will display any A4-E-C units as default-livery Su-27s, and players without the module cannot take control of unit, just as if they did not own any other DCS module in a multiplayer mission.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="q-is-there-a-manual-or-tutorials-">Q: Is there a manual or tutorials?</h3>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>! Locating the NATOPS manual for an A-4E/F is the gold standard for understanding this aircraft, but there is a lot of helpful guidance included in the user manual. To access the manual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once inside the cockpit, open the kneeboard by pressing RSHIFT+K</li>
<li>Read the PDF manual in <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C\Docs</code> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_DPA00CWoRfIsqgh7HYabvpFrOdtBxPi">read it online</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Past that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4kJt_8Jw9ByL10ar6b8rQg">Sidekick65&#39;s YouTube Channel</a> features high-quality video tutorials on many systems.</p>
<h3 id="q-is-there-a-paint-kit-i-can-use-to-create-my-own-a-4e-c-liveries-">Q: Is there a paint kit I can use to create my own A-4E-C liveries?</h3>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>! This <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19w_bD8xHJiZpAi1JbA2xyPDJpl9dje-4">A-4E-C Paintkit</a> includes the aircraft&#39;s top, bottom and fuel tanks. See the included liveries for helpful examples setting up your <em>description.lua</em> files.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liveries created for versions of the A-4E-C prior to 2.0 must update the material names in their <em>description.lua</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Install original or downloaded liveries just as you would for any other module, in <code>C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Liveries\A-4E-C</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Never put your hard work at risk by installing liveries to the module&#39;s files!</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-can-i-fly-the-a-4e-c-as-a-tanker-">Q: Can I fly the A-4E-C as a tanker?</h3>
<p><strong>No</strong>, not at this time.</p>
<h3 id="q-will-guided-weapons-like-agm-12-bullpup-or-agm-62-walleye-be-added-">Q: Will guided weapons like AGM-12 Bullpup or AGM-62 Walleye be added?</h3>
<p>The AGM-12C Bullpup is a possibility with more work, but no promises just yet! Our A-4E-C cockpit model lacks the TV monitor used for the Walleye display.</p>
<h3 id="q-why-doesn-t-the-a-4e-c-have-a-nosewheel-steering-button-">Q: Why doesn&#39;t the A-4E-C have a nosewheel steering button?</h3>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the A-4E had NWS. According to our research the the revisions and reworks relating to the NWS were applied to only the -F models. If you find evidence that E&#39;s did in fact have NWS, please share it!</p>
<h3 id="q-are-there-any-plans-to-simulate-other-variants-or-later-models-of-the-a-4-">Q: Are there any plans to simulate other variants or later models of the A-4?</h3>
<p><strong>No</strong>, there are no plans nor keen interest to pursue this, especially since there is a lot left to add and improve one with our beloved A-4E-C. Additionally, the advanced avionics in later models would not be able to be completed in a satisfying manner.</p>
<h3 id="q-why-doesn-t-the-a-4e-c-work-with-my-favorite-mission-or-multiplayer-scripting-system-">Q: Why doesn&#39;t the A-4E-C work with my favorite mission or multiplayer scripting system?</h3>
<p>Some scripts or other utilities need to be informed of the A-4E-C&#39;s existence or other specificities in order to accommodate it. If you know of a mod or script that should accommodate it, be sure to let the author know!</p>
<h3 id="q-what-s-the-theme-song-in-the-dcs-main-menu-">Q: What&#39;s the theme song in the DCS main menu?</h3>
